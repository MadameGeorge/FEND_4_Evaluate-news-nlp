# NLP Text Analysis App Project

## Overview
This is a 4th project made for Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree I took in May/June 2020. It required me to create a web app that uses Aylien API for text analysis. It figures out whether a text is negative or positive and if it's objective or subjective.

## Config
- To run this application you need your own API key from [here](https://developer.aylien.com/signup) 
- Once you have it, create `.env` file and add you key there (see `.env_sample` file to see how to add a key)

## Installation
1. Install all dependencies from 'package.json' by running `npm install` in command line

## Running
1. `npm run build-prod` to build production files
2. `npm run build-dev` to run webpack developer server
3. `npm run start` to run local node server 
4. `npm run test` to test the app
